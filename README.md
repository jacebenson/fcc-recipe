# Recipe

This project is to use the skills learned at FreeCodeCamp.

The stories from this project are listed on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-recipe-box).

Below I've listed them incase that changes;

1. User Story: I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.
1. User Story: I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.
1. User Story: I can click into any of those recipes to view it.
1. User Story: I can edit these recipes.
1. User Story: I can delete these recipes.
1. User Story: All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.
1. Hint:  You should prefix your local storage keys on CodePen, i.e. _username_recipes
